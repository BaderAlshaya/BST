# BST
This is a recursive-based implementation of the Binary Search Tree data structure. It is used to store string inputs from a text file in alphabatical order.

For the purpose of this data structure we will read string inputs from a text file and store them in a BST. The BST includes the following operations:

# . Insert a string to the tree in alphabetical order (dublicates allowed).

# . Copy the string contents of the entire tree.

# . Retrieve all instances of a key input.

# . Display all instsances of a key input.

# . Display all string contents within the tree.

# . Remove all instances of a key input.

# . Remove all string contents within the tree.

A make file is used to run the program.
