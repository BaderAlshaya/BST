# BST
This is a recursive-based implementation of the Binary Search Tree data structure. It is used to store string inputs from a text file in alphabetical order.

For the purpose of this data structure, we will read string inputs from a text file and store them in a BST. The BST includes the following operations:

# . Copy the contents of the entire tree.

# . Insert a string to the tree in alphabetical order.

# . Retrieve all instances of a key input.

# . Display all instances of a key input.

# . Display all string contents within the tree.

# . Remove all instances of a key input.

# . Remove all string contents from the tree.

A makefile is used to run the program.

# The stages (sprints) of this project to its completion is as follow:

# V1*: 
implement the basic structure of the data structure and support all the previous functions.
# V2*:
overload operators wherever possible and commit all the changes.
# V3*:
use const references wherever possible and commit all the changes.
# V4*: 
switch the entire data structure to a template form and commit all the changes.
